# TCGAImporter
This module imports data from TCGA by taking in a GDC manifest file, downloading the files listed on that manifest, renaming them to be human-friendly, and compiling them into a GCT file to be computer-friendly.

Remember that you will need to download a manifest file and a metadata file from the GDC data portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)
